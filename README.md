# Word-Embeddings
# Manipulating word Embeddings 

In this week's assignment, you are going to use a pre-trained word embedding for finding word analogies and equivalence. This exercise can be used as an Intrinsic Evaluation for the word embedding performance. In this notebook, you will apply linear algebra operations using NumPy to find analogies between words manually. This will help you to prepare for this week's assignment.
